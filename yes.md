Question 1 (60%):   600 words, excluding examples.
How do both interfaces compare with "normal" instant messaging apps.  How do both interfaces compare with spoken interaction?  Support your analysis with at least 2 examples from your own transcript and at least 5 examples from  5 different pairs. Make sure you indicate which transcripts you are using.

The interface used in the labs is different compared to the current popular instant messaging apps (for now on called "IM") because the communication is instant. Users immediately see what they and the other person are typing. Errors in communication and spelling mistakes are immediately shown.

        k  lein    g  e zsic  ch  t
    Example 1, conversation between me and s1767844

In example 1 you can see a self-repair of me, correcting the mistake "duik" to deuk. The other person typed "gezicht" as "gezsiccht", displaying that they are typing quickly and made a spelling mistake. In popular IM there is a possibility to correct such mistakes before you send a message.

Question 2 (30%):  400 words, excluding examples.
Towards the end of the experiment you swapped from one interface to using another interface. Did this have any effect on the interaction? If so, what effect did it have? Do you think that swapping from interface 1 to 2 is the same as starting fresh with interface 1 (and vice versa)? Support your analysis with at least 4 examples (from any pair).

Question 3 (10%)  200 words, excluding examples.
Which interface is better for the task of describing faces? Why? How could you improve it? Can you think of other tasks where the other interface would be better? 

Bonus of (up to 10%): 
Can you think of a quantitative analysis you could do to compare the two interfaces (computational, or manual). Very briefly describe your prediction, method of analysis and results.
