Question 1 (60%):   600 words, excluding examples.
How do both interfaces compare with "normal" instant messaging apps.  How do both interfaces compare with spoken interaction?  Support your analysis with at least 2 examples from your own transcript and at least 5 examples from  5 different pairs. Make sure you indicate which transcripts you are using.

The interface used in the labs is different compared to the current popular instant messaging apps (for now on called "IM") because the communication is instant. Users immediately see what they and the other person are typing. 

One of the differences that stand out is spelling mistakes and other errors are immediately shown. 

In example 1 you can see a self-repair of me, correcting the mistake "duik" to deuk. The other person typed "gezicht" as "gezsiccht", showing a sign that they are typing quickly and made a spelling mistake. In popular IM there is a possibility to correct such mistakes before you send a message. 

    ron d ho    ofd  ,  d    ui  k  deuk aan de bovenkant
        k  lein    g  e zsic  ch  t
    Example 1, conversation between me and s1767844

In the case IM users see they made a mistake after sending a message, they often correct the word they misspelled by retyping the word with an asterisk. This behaviour is also seen in the conversations in this interface.

    Example 2, conversation between s25718889 and s2763443

In this conversation, example 2, the user makes their correction clear by using an asterisk.

Example 3 shows that this correction with an asterisk can also occur while the user makes a mistake and realises it before typing the complete word. This sorf of self-repair looks similar to the self-repair used in spoken conversation. This kind of self-repair does not occur in IM, because the user can correct their word by deleting the previous typed letters.

Example 4 shows that interruption is possible in this interface. I am describing what I think I saw, a woman with narrowed eyes. While I am describing another detail that I noticed, my partner interrupts me saying that they didn't think the same. In popular IM this would not be possible. I would have typed out all the details I wanted to share with my partner before they had to chance to state that they don't agree with my description.

     ehh vrouwelijke met dichtgeknepen ogenbij mij had ze rehcts een    de
                                                        von  d  i  k  hier niet
    Example 4, conversation between me and s1767844

The possibility of interruptions is a similarity to spoken interaction. It depends on the type of interface what kind of overlapping is possible. In interface 1, the users share the same line. An interruption in that interface will cause that the conversation is hard to read and follow, since the words by both users will be mixed together. (You can see this effect looking at group B, where this interface got activated in the end:)

        b   i g wow      wtf
        arr oga n t   oh god
    Example 5, conversation between s2808986 and s3068676

     hmm  m      j a gek dit 
         go kjewow g         
    Example 6, conversation between s2728591 and s2550954   

In interface 2, the users can use continuer's phrases during their interaction.

     dike wenkbrauwen weerboven li p dondker en midden
                              j  a                   
    Example 7, conversation between s3036375 and s2377225

Because it's possible for both users to type at the same time, it allows users to acknowledge what the other is saying and agree or disagree with what they are saying while they're still typing a sentence. When an user disagrees, they have the possibility to take over the conversation after interrupting. 

                 nee  v     bi  j m ij wa ren wenkbrauwe
    dan links b    w enkbr  au        w     *

Question 2 (30%):  400 words, excluding examples.
Towards the end of the experiment you swapped from one interface to using another interface. Did this have any effect on the interaction? If so, what effect did it have? Do you think that swapping from interface 1 to 2 is the same as starting fresh with interface 1 (and vice versa)? Support your analysis with at least 4 examples (from any pair).

Question 3 (10%)  200 words, excluding examples.
Which interface is better for the task of describing faces? Why? How could you improve it? Can you think of other tasks where the other interface would be better? 

Bonus of (up to 10%): 
Can you think of a quantitative analysis you could do to compare the two interfaces (computational, or manual). Very briefly describe your prediction, method of analysis and results.
